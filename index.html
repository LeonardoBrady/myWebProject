            “We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born.
             The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia.
              Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton.
               We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people.
                In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds,
                 how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?”
            ― Richard Dawkins,<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31487.Unweaving_the_Rainbow"> Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder</a>

             “Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish. Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs, something that no other species has ever aspired to do.”

        </li>
            <br>
        <li class="q3"> “bad things, like good things don't happen any more often than they ought to by chance. the universe has no mind, no feelings, and no personality, so it doesn't do things in order to either hurt or please you. bad things happen because things happen.”
            ― Richard Dawkins, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11256979-the-magic-of-reality">The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True</a>
