        Some Quotes I like!
    </h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li class="q1"> 
            “We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born.
             The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia.
              Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton.
               We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people.
                In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds,
                 how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?”
            ― Richard Dawkins,<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31487.Unweaving_the_Rainbow"> Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder</a>

        <br>
        <li class="q2">
             “Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish. Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs, something that no other species has ever aspired to do.”
            ― Richard Dawkins, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene">The Selfish Gene</a>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <li class="q3"> “bad things, like good things don't happen any more often than they ought to by chance. the universe has no mind, no feelings, and no personality, so it doesn't do things in order to either hurt or please you. bad things happen because things happen.”
            ― Richard Dawkins, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11256979-the-magic-of-reality">The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True</a>

                <p> Two cladograms derived from different scientific interpretations of evolutionary relationships of mammals based on morphological and and genetic characters of species.  Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 19: 430-438.

                The left hand cladogram is based on evidence from morphology, while the right hand one is based on evidence from genetics.
                 The two trees are similar, but they are not identical. See if you can identify how many ways these two cladograms differ.
                  This is one of the main difficulties of phylogenetic systematics.
                   The “true” evolutionary tree is lost in the distant past and all that scientists can do is find evidence for the best evolutionary hypothesis.
                    Sometimes different data sets do not give the exact same results.
                     Although we will never know for certain what the true evolutionary tree of any particular clade is the correct one,
                      probability suggests that as more and more evidence is collected the resulting cladograms are closer and closer to the truth.

                    <li>
                       <strong> Australopithecus (4 to 2 million years ago): </strong>
                       <br>
                        Species like Australopithecus afarensis, exemplified by the fossil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_(Australopithecus)">"Lucy,"</a> demonstrated an upright walking posture but retained some ape-like features.

                    <li>
                     <strong>Homo habilis (2.4 to 1.4 million years ago):</strong>   
                     <br>
                        Homo habilis, an early member of the Homo genus, is associated with the use of basic stone tools, representing an early technological leap.

                        <br>
                        Homo erectus exhibited a larger brain size and more advanced stone tools, with evidence suggesting migration out of Africa into Asia and Europe.

                        <br>
                        Various hominin species in this category displayed a mix of Homo erectus and modern Homo sapiens characteristics,
                         including advancements in tool use and social structures.

                        <br>
                        Homo sapiens, originating in Africa, developed sophisticated tools, art, language, and complex social structures.
                        Migration out of Africa occurred, leading to the global dispersion of Homo sapiens.

                    <strong>Tool Use and Manipulation:</strong>
                    <br>
                    One of the primary reasons humans evolved to have opposable thumbs is the advantage it provides for manipulating objects and tools.
                     The opposable thumb allows for a precision grip, enabling humans to grasp and use tools with greater dexterity.

                    <strong>Fine Motor Skills:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The development of opposable thumbs contributed to the evolution of fine motor skills.
                     This enhanced manual dexterity allowed early humans to perform intricate tasks,
                      such as crafting tools, creating art, and engaging in complex activities that were crucial for survival and advancement.

                    <strong>Tool-Making and Technology:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Opposable thumbs played a pivotal role in the development of tool-making and technology.
                     The ability to create and use tools is a defining feature of human evolution, influencing our capacity to hunt, build shelters, and adapt to various environments.

                    <strong>Adaptation to Environment:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The opposable thumb provided a significant adaptive advantage in various environments.
                     Whether in forests, grasslands, or other landscapes, the versatility of the human hand, facilitated by the opposable thumb,
                      allowed for effective interaction with diverse surroundings.

                    <strong>Social Interaction and Communication:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The evolution of opposable thumbs is linked to the social nature of humans.
                     The ability to grasp objects, including each other's hands, likely played a role in social bonding and communication.
                      This physical capability might have contributed to the development of complex social structures and cooperation among early human groups.
